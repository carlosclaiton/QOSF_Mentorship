# TASK 1

To solve the task of finding numbers less than a given integer ```k``` from a list of integers using quantum computing, we can leverage Grover's algorithm.

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output valus, using just ```O(âˆšN)``` evaluations of the function, where (N) is the size of the function's domain. This algorithm is particularly useful for searching through a database or list of items, making it a suitable choice for our task. 

Given the nature of the task, we need to adapt Grover's algorithm to work with our specific problem. The algorithm involves initializing a quantum system in a superposition state, applying a series of quantum gates(including Grover's diffusion operator and Grover's operator), and then measuring the system to find the desired item. The number of qubits required for this task is directly related to the size of the list ```list_n``` we are searching through.

Here's a conceptual outline of how the algorithm could be adapted for our task : 

1. <b>Initialization</b> : Initialize a quantum system in a superposition state that represents all possible states of the list ```list_n```. This involves creating a superposition of all numbers in the list.

2. <b>Grover's Operator</b> : Apply Grover's operator to amplify the probability of the states taht represent numbers less than ```k```. This operator is designed to mark the correct item(in our case, numbers less than ```k```) with a higher probability. 

3. <b>Measurement</b> : Measure the quantum system to find the numbers less than ```k```. Since the algorithm is probabilistic, we may need to repeat the measurement process multiple times to increase the likelihood of finding the correct numbers.

4. <b>Post-processing</b>: After obtaining the results, we need to post-process them to extract the numbers less than k from the quantum states.


The number of qubits required for this task is determined by the size of the list list_n. Each number in the list requires a qubit to represent it in the superposition state. Therefore, the number of qubits (Q) is equal to the size of the list (N).

The validity of this approach for all kinds of numbers in the list list_n is based on the general applicability of Grover's algorithm to unstructured search problems. The algorithm does not rely on the specific values of the numbers in the list but rather on their representation in the quantum system. As long as the list contains positive integers, the algorithm can be applied to find numbers less than k.

Here's a simplified pseudocode representation of the algorithm:

```py
def less_than_k(k, list_n):
    # Initialize the quantum system in a superposition state
    quantum_system = initialize_superposition(list_n)
    
    # Apply Grover's operator to amplify the probability of states representing numbers less than k
    for _ in range(grover_iterations(len(list_n))):
        quantum_system = apply_grover_operator(quantum_system, k)
    
    # Measure the quantum system to find the numbers less than k
    results = measure_quantum_system(quantum_system)
    
    # Post-process the results to extract the numbers less than k
    numbers_less_than_k = [number for number in results if number < k]
    
    return numbers_less_than_k
```

To implement Grover's algorithm in Python for finding numbers less than a given integer k from a list of integers, we'll use Qiskit, a popular quantum computing framework. This implementation will focus on creating a quantum circuit that represents the problem and then executing it on a quantum simulator to find the numbers less than k.

First, ensure you have Qiskit installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install qiskit
```
