# QOSF Mentorship Repository

This repository is part of the Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF) mentorship program, where I am working under the guidance of Dr. Carlos Kuhn from the University of Cannberra / Open Source Institute.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of quantum computing and its applications through the QOSF mentorship program. Under the mentorship of Dr. Carlos Kuhn, I will be working on various tasks and projects to enhance my skills and knowledge in quantum computing.

## Projects and Tasks

This repository will contain various projects and tasks that I will be working on during the mentorship program. These projects will include:

- **Task 1:** Screening Task
- **Task 2:** Quantum circuit conversion and processing

## Contributions

This repository will be regularly updated with new projects and tasks as they are completed. Contributions to this repository are welcome, and I encourage anyone interested in quantum computing to explore and learn from the projects and tasks contained within.
